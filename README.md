# Getting Started with Auth react

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn run start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.


### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `firebase deploy`
deployed using firebase 
https://pokemon-auth-app.web.app/




note: need to make some changes to allow Auth o to redirect to https://pokemon-auth-app.web.app instead of http://localhost:3000]
